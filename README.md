## 💡 How It Works

1. Users enter their goals in input fields.
2. Once all goals are filled, checkboxes become active.
3. Toggling a checkbox updates the progress bar visually.
4. All data (tasks and completion status) is saved to `localStorage`.
5. Reloading the page restores your goals and progress.
